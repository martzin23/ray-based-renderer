# Ray Based Renderer

## Description

This is a renderer that uses ray tracing or ray marching to render a scene. 
Primitive bodies can be added/removed/moved/scaled/colored using the built in scene editor and the scene can be exported to a `.txt` file for later use.
The bodies can also be made reflective and emissive.
It can render fractals with basic ray marching and with pathtracing.
The purpose of making this was to learn OpenGL. Created in March 2025.

## Usage

There are two main keybinds:
- `Tab` - toggles GUI visibility
- `Alt` - toggles free mouse

The rest of the keyboard/mouse controls are described in the `Info` tab of the GUI. Some UI elements also have a questiom mark that displays a description when hovered over.
